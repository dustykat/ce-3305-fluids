    "\n",
    "- Develop a systematic method to solve closed (solvable) engineering problems.\n",
    "- Develop *muscle memory* to apply the process\n",
    "- Become accustomed to documenting effort\n",

    "1. State the problem\n",
    "2. Sketch the situation (sketching no matter how ugly helps organize thoughts!). Identify (list) known quantities \n",
    "3. Identify (list) unknown quantities \n",
    "4. Identify (list) governing principles and equations that appear relevant to the problem\n",
    "5. Starting from one or more governing principles and the known quantities solve for the unknowns.\n",
    "6. Validate/discuss results\n",
