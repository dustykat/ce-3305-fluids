    "\n",
    "In real fluids, markers such as dye, smoke, heat are used to visualize how things flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The markers are tracers; the tracer hypothesis is that the tracer moves with the host fluid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> [MIT videos of different flow regimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuQyKGuXJOs) \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the patterns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeline** is a line formed by marking adjacent particles at some instant\n",
    "- **Pathline** is the trajectory of a particular fluid particle\n",
    "- **Streakline** is the trajectory of many particles that pass through some common point in space\n",
    "- **Streamline** is a line in a flow field that is tangent to velocity; no flow crosses a streamline (3D equivalent is called a streamtube)\n",
    "\n",
    "In steady flow streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines are coincident.  In unsteady (time-varying) flow this relationship is not preserved (and the three patterns will look different)\n",
