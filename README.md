Engineering Fluid Mechanics 

## Structure
This entire directory should be placed on a web server just off the web root into a directory named ce-3305-webroot
The structure contains a JupyterBook rendering of the instructor's notes.  Students are expected to be able to employ Computational Thinking methods from ENGR-1330, hence the JupyterBook environment will be familiar.
