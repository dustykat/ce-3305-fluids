# 
# :::{admonition} Hints, Notes, and Warnings
# Throughout this book, sections like this one appear containing either "Notes", or some kind of "Hint".   
# Warnings are probably not relevant in this book, but are more useful for a operations manual.  There might be a few to caution against something dumb.

# :::{note}
# Here is a note. This Jupyter Book is a work in progress, but has the distinct advantage of being able to share working scripts, plus always be available as long as AWS is in business. 
# :::
# 
# :::{warning}
# Here is a warning block.  In the future, when I learn how, this Jupyter Book will be interactive so you can run the scripts directy on your browser.

# ## Lesson Outline
# 1. Syllabus overview
# 2. Problem Solving and Documentation
# 3. Computational Hydraulics
# 4. What is Fluid Mechanics?
# 5. Dimensions and Units
# 
# ### Syllabus Overview
# 
# The working syllabus is located at [http://54.243.252.9/ce-3305-webroot/0-Syllabus/ce-3305-2022-2-syllabus.html](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3305-webroot/0-Syllabus/ce-3305-2022-2-syllabus.html). The overview summarizes the contents of the syllabus, and how to access through blackboard, and how to upload homeworks (demo in face-to-face class; on-line will have to suffice with the video).  The first quiz will ask for the URL to the instructor notes entry page.
