    "Consider a floating body tilted by an angle $\\Delta \\Theta$, as shown in {numref}`stability-1`. For the untilted body the point G is\n",
    "the centre of gravity of the body where the body weight, W, acts. The point B is the center of buoyancy\n",
    "(the centroid of the displaced volume of fluid) where the upward buoyancy force, FB, acts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the body is tilted the centre of buoyancy moves to a new position, B', because the shape of the\n",
    "displaced volume changes. A new point, M, may be defined, called the METACENTRE. This is the\n",
    "point where a vertical line drawn upwards from the new centre of buoyancy, B', of the tilted body\n",
    "intersects the line of symmetry of the body. The buoyancy force, FB, now acts through B'.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the center diagram in the figure we observe that W and FB generate a RESTORING MOMENT (Righting Moment) that\n",

    "W and FB generate an OVERTURNING MOMENT that rotates the body even further in the tilted direction (the body gets too turnt!).\n",
