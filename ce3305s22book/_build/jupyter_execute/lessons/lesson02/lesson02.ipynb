    "Fluid statics deals with forces in fluids that are have no relative motion within the fluid.  The vessel containing the fluid may be at non-zero velocity or acceleration, but the fluid body within the vessel has no relative motion.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Body forces are developed without contact and are distributed over the entire volume of a fluid.  In the sketch the weight of the sphere is a body force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface forces act at boundaries of a medium through contant.  The normal force in the sketch (which is the product of pressure and area) is a surface force, defined on the surface of the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stress is the limiting value of $\\frac{dF}{dA}$; in the sketch there are two stresses: a normal stress (usually called pressure), and a tangential stress (usually called shear).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shear stresses are formed by friction, no-slip assumption, and other practically occuring situations."
