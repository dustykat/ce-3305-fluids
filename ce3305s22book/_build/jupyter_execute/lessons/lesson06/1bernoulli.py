# # Bernoulli Equation Applications
# 
# Recall from last time the equation of 
# 
# - steady ($\frac{\partial}{\partial t} = 0$)
# - inviscid ($ \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} = 0$)
# - gravity vector is down ($-z$)
# - incompressible ($\rho = constant$)
# - irrotational ($curl(V)=0$)
# 
# Results in 
# 
# $ \frac{p_1}{\rho g} + \frac{V_1^2}{2g} + z_1 = \frac{p_2}{\rho g} + \frac{V_2^2}{2g} + z_2  $

# Below are some examples illustrating its use

# ## Example: Flow out of a holy tank

# ## Example: How high will a fountain go?
# 
# Consider the fountains at a resort.  What kind of pressures and velocities are required to make the show happen?
