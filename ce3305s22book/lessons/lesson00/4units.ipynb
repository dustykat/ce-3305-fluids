    "Consistent units is a set of units with conversion factors equal to unity.  The U.S. Customary (Imperial) is conststent as is the SI (System Internationale), but mixing systems leads to spectular errors (the Hubble Telescope comes to mind!). Using a single system, when possible, reduces errors because of fewer arithmetic operations.  Many practical cases commonly use blends of both systems so unit conversions are required.  The problem solving format example contained embedded conversions.\n",
