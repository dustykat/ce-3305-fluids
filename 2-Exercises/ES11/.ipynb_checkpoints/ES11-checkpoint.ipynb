    "The figure is a schematic of a turbofan engine. On an airframe the engine takes in air, a portion of which passes through the compressor into the combustion chamber where fuel is added and ignited, and out through the turbine; the remainder of the air bypasses the compressor and is accelerated by the fans. The mass flow rate of bypass air to the mass flow rate through the compressor-combuster-turbine path is called the “bypass ratio.”\n",
    "The total flow rate of air entering the turbofan engine is 412 kg/s with a velocity relative to the engine of 400 m/s. The engine has a bypass ratio of 6.1:2. The bypass air exits at 660 m/s, whereas the air through the compressor-combustor-turbine path exits at 990 m/s.\n",
