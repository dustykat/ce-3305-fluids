    "### Density\n",
    "Density (or mass density) is the mass per unit volume.  Typical symbol is $\\rho$, sometimes subscripted to identify fluid in multiiple fluid problems.\n",

    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{m}{V} $$\n",

    "$$\\gamma = \\rho g$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific gravity is the ratio of density of a fluid to a reference fluid.  In Civil Engineering the reference fluid is typically liquid water. Typical symbol is $S$ \n",

    "\n",
    "### Bulk Modulus (of elasticity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk modulus relates the change in volume of a fluid element to a change in pressure.  For liquids it is quite high, gasses quite a bit smaller - it is essentially a Hooke's law (springs) for a continuum element.  It conveys how much pressure change is needed to effect a incremental volume change.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_v = -\\frac{dp}{(\\frac{dV}{V})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionally it is a pressure.  For water at terresterial pressure and temperature its value is upwards of 2.2 GPa (about 23 atmospheres); for solid steel well over 150 GPa (about 1550 atmospheres).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our practical sense, gas is compressible, water is not very compressible, steel smaller still.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the properties above are temperature dependent, and in gasses the compressibility is small, hence they are called compressible fluids.\n",

    "### Specific Internal Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy a unit mass possesses because of its state of molecular activity.  Typical symbol is $u$\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The symbol $u$ is also commonly used for the x-component, or streamline component of velocity.  Be aware of context to avoid confusion.  In some documents $U$ is the velocity vector - again the context should be a clue.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Specific Enthalpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy a substance possesses because of internal energy and applied normal stress (aka pressure).  Typical symbol is $h = u + \\frac{p}{\\rho}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equation of State\n",
