\begin{enumerate}
\item (Problem 1.34 pg 26)
Natural gas is stored in a spherical tank at a temperature of 10$^o$C.  
At a given initial time, the pressure in the tank is 100 kPa--gage, and the atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa--absolute.  
Some time later, after more gas has been compressed into the tank, the pressure in the tank is 200 kPa--gage, and the temperature is still 10$^o$C.
What is the mass ratio of gas in the tank when $p$ =  200 kPa--gage, to when the pressure was 100 kPa--gage?
\end{enumerate}
