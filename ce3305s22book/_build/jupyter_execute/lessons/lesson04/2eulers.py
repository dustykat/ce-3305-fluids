# # Euler's Equation and the Bernoulli Equation
# 
# Here we will start with the Euler equation and from a sequence of plausible stipulations arrive at the Bernoulli Equation.  This development is an alternative to the way most books present the Bernoulli Equation - choose whichever makes more sense to you.
