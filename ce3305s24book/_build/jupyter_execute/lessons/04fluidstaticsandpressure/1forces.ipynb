    "Now we consider the forces generated on submerged objects by hydrostatic pressure.  \n",
    "It's the same force you feel on your [è€³](https://translate.yandex.com/?lang=en-ja&text=ears) when you dive to the bottom of a [schwimmbad](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/german-english/schwimmbad).\n",
