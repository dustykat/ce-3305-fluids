    "# Bouyancy \n",
    "\n",
    "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a partially or fully immersed object. In a column of liquid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying liquid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of liquid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a liquid is greater than at the top of the object. The pressure difference results in a net upward force on the object. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the pressure difference, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is equivalent to the weight of the displaced fluid. "

    "[Will it float?](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=will+it+float) was a popular TV segment on Late Night with David Letterman.  It is a direct appeal to bouyancy in terms of everyday objects, of course its purpose was entertainment. \n",
