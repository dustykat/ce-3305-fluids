    "A liquid is one kind of fluid, but it has a few added properties that are important.  One such property is surface tension, $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface tension is the force per unit area required to separate two fluids.  It is measured with a ring tensiometer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_No%C3%BCy_ring_method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_No%C3%BCy_ring_method), and a few other ways.\n",
    "Dimensionally it is a force per unit length, and is one reason why liquids can rise up capillary tubes, or into porous materials (like a sponge).  Surface tension controls how liquids spread or bead up on a surface.\n",
