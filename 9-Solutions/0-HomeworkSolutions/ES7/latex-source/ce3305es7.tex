\textbf{Purpose} :  Apply Lagrangian and Eulerian concepts to determine point values of velocity and acceleration.\\
\textbf{Assessment Criteria} : Completion, plausible solutions, use \textbf{R} as a calculator. \\~\\
\textbf{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Problem 4.6 pg 157)
For a given hypothetical flow, the velocity from time t=0 to t=5 seconds was u = 2m/s, v=0.  
Then from time t=5 seconds to t=10 seconds, the velocity was u= +3 m/s, v=-4m/s.
A dye streak was started at a point in the flow field at time t=0, and the path of a particle in the fluid was also traced from that same point starting at the same time.
Draw to scale the streakline, path line of the particle, and streamlines at time t=10 seconds.


\item (Problem 4.30 pg 159)
Figure \ref{fig:Nozzle} is a schematic of a liquid flowing through a two-dimensional slot with a velocity of 
$V = 2(q_0/b)(t/t_0)$, where $q_0$ and $t_0$ are reference values.
What is the local acceleration at $x=2B$ and $y=0$ in terms of $B$,$t$,$t_0$, and $q_0$?
