# ## Intensive and Extensive Properties
# 
# Extensive properties apply to a system and are associated with a fixed quantity of mass.
# 
# Intensive properties apply to components of a system, and are defined with restect to a boundary in space. 
# 
# Imagine a gallon of water; its weight is an extensive property assocated with that gallon.  The specific weight, $\gamma$, is the weight per volume is an intensive property. The properties in the textboox (pp 14-19) are for the most part intensive properties (mostly defined per unit volume)

# One gallon, and a 30cc sample removed

# {numref}`gallon-properties` is a schematic of a simple example to relate extensive and intensive properties.  
# We first weigh the entire gallon, 8.32 lbs. Then we weigh the 30cc subsample, 0.065 lbs.
# 
# The extensive property of weight for the gallon is 8.32 lbs; the extensive property of weight for the 30cc is 0.065 lbs.
# 
# If we now compute specific weights of each entity and adjust to a common basis volume:
