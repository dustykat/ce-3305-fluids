# # Introduction
# 
# ## Lesson Outline
# 1. Problem Solving and Documentation
#   - Problem Solving Protocol
#   - Jupyter Notebooks (preferred way to record your work)
#   - Illustrative Example
# 2. What is Fluid Mechanics?
#   - Definition of a Fluid
#   - Fundamental Properties

# ### Problem Solving and Documentation
# 
# The exercises are instruments to practice problem solving.  
# 
# - Format 
# - Process
# 
# The purpose of such practice is to:
# 
# - Develop a systematic method to solve closed (solvable) engineering problems.
# - Develop *muscle memory* to apply the process
# - Become accustomed to documenting effort
# 
# #### Suggested Protocol
# 
# 1. State the problem
# 2. Sketch the situation (sketching no matter how ugly helps organize thoughts!). Identify (list) known quantities 
# 3. Identify (list) unknown quantities 
# 4. Identify (list) governing principles and equations that appear relevant to the problem
# 5. Starting from one or more governing principles and the known quantities solve for the unknowns.
# 6. Validate/discuss results
# 
# #### Suggested Format (By-Hand)
# 
# The format will differ if you prepare a Notebook, or work the problem by-hand. Here is an example worked out on paper which will be repeated in a Notebook.
