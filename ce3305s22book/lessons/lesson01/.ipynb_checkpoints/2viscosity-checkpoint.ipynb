    "# Viscosity\n",
    "\n",
    "\"... a property of a fluid that relates the resistance to motion (in a thin layer) when a shear force is applied...\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "This somewhat useless definition is trying to convey how fluids deform under shear, and more importantly the rate of deformation.  \n",
    "Consider a steel sheet that we cut with a shear (like sicssors), if we want to cut fast we need a lot of force; using the same shears on an equal thickness of plastic sheet will take less force for the same rate of cut.  \n",
    "This solids analog to viscosity conveys that steel is more viscous than plastic (usually).\n",

    "Viscosity Schematic\n",
    "```\n",
    "{numref}`viscosity-one` Is a diagram attempting to convey the concept of viscosity.  In the drawing the thickness $\\partial y$ and the deformation angle $\\partial \\alpha$ are small, and the sine of the angle is approximated by the angle itself.\n",

    "Viscosity Trigonometry\n",

    "{numref}`viscosity-two` shows the relevant trigonometry to relate deformation rate to shear stress.\n",

    "```\n",
    "{numref}`newtonian` defines a Newtonian fluid and introduces the absolute viscosity $\\mu$ in terms of the thin layer, cross-layer velocity profile $\\frac{du}{dy}$ and the applied shear stress $\\tau$.  The viscosity has dimensions of $\\frac{Force \\cdot Time}{Area}$\n",

    "Apparent viscosity (definition) power-law model\n",
    "```\n",
    "{numref}`non-newtonian` shows a typical power-law model of viscosity; the term is referred to as an apparent viscosity.  Many real fluids are Non-Newtonian and will have some type of viscosity model to explain the deformation behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kinematic Viscosity\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio of absolute (or apparent) viscosity to the fluid density is called the *kinematic* viscosity. The usual symbol is $\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}$  The kinematic viscosity has dimensions of $\\frac{Area}{Time}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Comments\n",
    "Viscous effects cause a velocity gradient (profile) to develop across the fluid layers as shown in {numref}`slip-profile`.\n",

    "Velocity Profile Diagram\n",
    "```\n",
    "{numref}`slip-profile` is a diagram of the cross-layer velocity profile. The slope of the profile is related to shear force and hence the apparent or absolute viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The no-slip condition is deduced from experiments - in my opinion it is an assumption that velocity vanishes at the contact interface.  In your future studies keep this in mind; it is quite possible that slip occurs at some scale, however it is a useful and accepted boundary condition.\n",
