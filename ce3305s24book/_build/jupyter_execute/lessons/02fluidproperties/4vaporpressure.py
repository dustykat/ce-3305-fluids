# # Vapor Pressure (pp. 27)
# 
# [Vapor pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure) is the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system.
# 
# It varies by substance for example [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure_of_water) is extensively tabulated, as is that for [mercury](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-66a1ade54071892930184393b1802e69/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-66a1ade54071892930184393b1802e69.pdf), and many other practically useful substances.  It matters most in barometers and pipelines that have negative gage pressures - if the negative pressure gets too large the liquid will flash into vapor and can stop flow or go boom!
